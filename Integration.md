## Integrated assay vs RNA assay
You should use the integrated assay when trying to 'align' cell states that are shared across datasets (i.e. for clustering, visualization, learning pseudotime, etc.)
You should use the RNA assay when exploring the genes that change either across clusters, trajectories, or conditions.
